A few of useful files for the MPI course.

The file "mpibatch.sge" should be used for submitting MPI jobs to the backend
of morar using the Sun Grid Engine batch system. Instructions are included as
comments in the file itself.

The file "mpibatch.pbs" should be used for submitting MPI jobs to the backend
of ARCHER using the Portable Batch System PBS. Instructions are included as
comments in the file itself.

The Makefiles should be easier to use than compiling by hand.
